                - Diabetes is a serious complex condition which can affect the entire body. Diabetes requires daily self
                care and if complications develop, diabetes can have a significant impact on quality of life and can
                reduce life expectancy. While there is currently no cure for diabetes, you can live an enjoyable life by
                learning about the condition and effectively managing it.

                - Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood
                glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the
                pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn't
                make enough or any insulin or doesn't use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn't
                reach your cells.
